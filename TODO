- add a Makefile that also runs tests and repo tests
- finish documentation
- be more thorough with the LICENSE stuff
- add and clean up the nix code (doesnt use dbgltool, uses a spec-conformant scheme)
- fix the TODOs in Readme.md

Upstream:
  .gnu_debuglink:
    - find a spec
    - (alterntively) find who is responsible
    - find out why it's limited to a basename
    - get it extended if possible
  .gnu_debugaltlink
    - what is this? it can be found in the binutils and elfutils (IIRC) source
  debugedit:
    - why does `-l` require write access
    - behavior of `-b` without `-d` is unclear, interface should be refactored if unnecessary
    - `-b /` doesn't work? (`-b /build` does)
    - `DWARF version 0 unhandled` on compressed sections is misleading (-> get a better error
      message, that perhaps even suggests using objcopy to decompress)
  objcopy:
    - `objcopy --add-gnu-debuglink tagetpath somebin` appears to take the path of the target
      file relative to CWD and not relative to somebin. This seems unintutive to me; but at
      the least, it would be nice if the error message somehow clarified this
